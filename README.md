# MimiK
MimiK is a portable, pure-C collection of kernel-style primitives for ARM microcontrollers. It provides allocators, mutexes, semaphores, queues, and utilities without an RTOS, CMSIS, or architecture-specific code. Designed to be readable, hackable, and dropped into any bare-metal or RTOS-based MCU project.
